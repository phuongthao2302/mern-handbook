# HTML
**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the standard language for structuring and organizing content on the web, giving webpages their meaning and structure.

## HTML Boilerplate
This is the standard format or skeleton of writing HTML code.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Hello Word!</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

## Tags, Elements, etc...

- *HTML Elements* : The Standard elements that browser recognizes.

- *HTML tags* : Components used to structure web pages; they act as containers for content or other tags.

- *Attributes* : Provide additional information about a tag.

example:

```html
<html lang="en">
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</html>
```

- `<p>` is Opening tag

- `This is a paragraph.` is the Content

- `</p>` Clossing tag

- The entire Structure (`<p>....</p>`) is an HTML element

- `lang="en"` is an attribute where `lang` is the attribute name and `"en"` is its value. It works with either double quotes (`lang="en"`) or single quotes (`lang='en'`) around the value. Both are valid in HTML

## Paragraph Element
The `<p>` HTML element represents a paragraph.

## Heading Elements
The `<h1>` to `<h6>` HTML elements represent six levels of section headings.  
`<h1>` is the highest section level, and `<h6>` is the lowest.
